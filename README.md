# Sectrai Shared API

Shared, product-scoped persistence API for Sectrai synthetic demo products. It uses one Neon Postgres database and one Render web service. It never connects to Sektral, Xontainer, Yapıborsası, or any other database.

## Record contract

Every record is scoped by `product`, `workspaceId`, and `moduleId`:

```ts
{ id, product, workspaceId, moduleId, values, status, createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy }
```

`values` is a bounded JSON object (48 KB maximum). The API rejects unknown request fields, malformed scope identifiers, and requests whose product key is absent or wrong.

## API

All product routes require `X-Sectrai-Product-Key`. A product `sectrai-health` maps to the server environment variable `SHARED_API_KEY_HEALTH`. Missing key configuration is intentionally a `401` fail-closed response.

```text
GET    /api/products/:product/workspaces/:workspaceId/modules/:moduleId/records
POST   /api/products/:product/workspaces/:workspaceId/modules/:moduleId/records
PATCH  /api/products/:product/workspaces/:workspaceId/modules/:moduleId/records/:recordId
DELETE /api/products/:product/workspaces/:workspaceId/modules/:moduleId/records/:recordId
```

- `GET` returns `{ records }`.
- `POST` accepts `{ values, status?, createdBy? }` and returns `201 { record }`.
- `PATCH` accepts `{ values, status? }` and returns `{ record }`.
- `DELETE` returns `204` only when the record exists in the exact product/workspace/module scope.

## Run and migrate

```bash
npm install
DATABASE_URL='your Neon URL' npm run db:migrate
DATABASE_URL='your Neon URL' SHARED_API_KEY_HEALTH='...' npm start
```

`npm test` is a real Neon integration test. It creates records only under the temporary `sectrai-integration-test` product, verifies create → list → edit → a new Prisma connection → delete, and cleans those records up.

## Product adaptation guide

1. Add a strong `SHARED_API_KEY_<PRODUCT_SUFFIX>` value to Render. Example: `sectrai-health` → `SHARED_API_KEY_HEALTH`.
2. Add the same key to that product’s Vercel build environment as `VITE_SHARED_API_KEY_<PRODUCT_SUFFIX>` only for these owner-gated synthetic demos.
3. Map the product’s existing local object into `values`; retain its product-specific status in `status`. Use a stable workspace/module pair, for example `health-demo` / `operation-groups`.
4. Replace local `list/create/update/delete` calls with the generic routes above, preserving the product’s own response adapter shape.
5. Keep the local JSON server as a development fallback only if needed. The production client must fail visibly when the shared API is unreachable; never silently write in-memory data.
6. Verify live create → reload/list → edit → delete with the product’s key before enabling the next product.

## Safety boundary

The service stores only product-owned synthetic demo records. It does not make AI calls, execute product actions, or interpret `values`. Product-level Vercel admin gates remain the outer authentication layer; this API key is a second product boundary, not a replacement for user authentication.

## GM2 synthetic vision adapter

`src/gcl/vision.ts` provides a non-wired, synthetic-only document-field proposal adapter based on the MagicScan form-field pattern. It accepts no raw image, camera input, credential, provider client, or live mode; it returns masked, owner-review-only proposals with `confidence: 0`. Its D1–D12 review packet revalidates scope, integrity, unexpired consent, bounded review time, bounded synthetic-evidence freshness, a causally coherent review deadline, exact governance-derived expiry/deadline math, plain own-data records, case-insensitive maker–checker identity, dense own-data field arrays, well-formed UTF-8-bound text, an exact built-in clock boundary, and descriptor-checked proposal-field records before recording an independent review. It does not authorize or perform apply/send. See [the GM2 contract](docs/GCL_VISION_CONTRACT.md).
